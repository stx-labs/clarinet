# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to this product! We welcome any contributions, whether it's bug fixes, new features, or improvements to the existing codebase.

### Your First Pull Request

Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this free video series:

[How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)

To help you get familiar with our contribution process, we have a list of [good first issues](../../issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) that contain enhancements or bugs that have a relatively limited scope. This is a great place to get started.

If you decide to fix an issue, please be sure to check the comment thread in case somebody is already working on a fix. If nobody is working on it at the moment, please leave a comment stating that you intend to work on it so other people don’t accidentally duplicate your effort.

If somebody claims an issue but doesn’t follow up for more than two weeks, it’s fine to take it over but you should still leave a comment. **Issues won't be assigned to anyone outside the core team**.

### Contribution Prerequisites

- Rust (>=1.89.0) and Cargo installed
