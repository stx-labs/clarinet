# Shell Completions

Follow the instructions specific to your shell to add completions for clarinet using these files:

- **bash**: _clarinet.bash_
- **elvish**: _clarinet.elv_
- **fish**: _clarinet.fish_
- **powershell**: _\_clarinet.ps1_
- **zsh**: _\_clarinet_

These files are automatically generated by `clap` based on the arguments structs in _src/frontend/cli.rs_. To regenerate them after making changes, use:

```sh
clarinet completions (bash|elvish|fish|powershell|zsh)
```

# Examples

For example, if you want zsh completions

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.zsh/completions
# Generate the completion file
clarinet completions zsh
mv _clarinet ~/.zsh/completions/_clarinet

# Make sure the directory is in fpath
echo 'fpath=(~/.zsh/completions $fpath)' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'autoload -Uz compinit && compinit' >> ~/.zshrc

# Reload
source ~/.zshrc
```

And for bash completions (You will need the `bash-completion` package installed)

```sh
# After running `clarinet completions bash` run 1 of the following:

# Install for all users
sudo install -m 644 clarinet.bash /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/clarinet
# Install for current user
install -m 644 clarinet.bash ~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions/clarinet
```
